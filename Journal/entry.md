## Day1 - Project Planning 

## How I came up with this idea
  So This is my first official hardware project. i am so excited for this .i wanted to build something which i can help me learn  hardware and engineering with linux 
  environment as well. So i was searching for the project that teaches me both .So i decided to work on this Smart mirror based on raspberry pi .i had earlier decided to do 
  the project but becasue of the lack of the sufficient material i was unable to make .Thanks to hackclub for this Amazing concept to help the geeks to learn by providing 
  guidance and grant. i am excited to work on this project so It would be great learning and fun working on this project. 

 
## What i researched Today 
  So Today i learned that if a reflective glass is placed infont of light source like those light sources(phone or monitor) can be seen from outside and remaining place of 
  glass can still act as mirror. so we will be basicaaly using this principle in our project. liek first of all we place a monitor behind the reflective mirror and then the
  first of all the it will normall act as mirror we can't see anything behind that, but if monitor is turned the place from where light source is coming from monitor like 
  date-time,etc can be seen from outside of the mirror.  
  
  Next thing i did is i searched the what are the material required to make this project. i made their list and how will they be used in project and made the rouch sketch .

After this i made the Bill of Materials and made the google sheet, which i uploaded in the repository.

After doing this i created the Gihub repository and arranged the files ,basically did this github repo work .
