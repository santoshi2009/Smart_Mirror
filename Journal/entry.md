## Day1 - Project Planning 

## How I came up with this idea
  So This is my first official hardware project. i am so excited for this .i wanted to build something which i can help me learn  hardware and engineering with linux 
  environment as well. So i was searching for the project that teaches me both .So i decided to work on this Smart mirror based on raspberry pi .i had earlier decided to do 
  the project but becasue of the lack of the sufficient material i was unable to make .Thanks to hackclub for this Amazing concept to help the geeks to learn by providing 
  guidance and grant. i am excited to work on this project so It would be great learning and fun working on this project. 

 
## What i researched Today 
  So Today i learned that if a reflective glass is placed infont of light source like those light sources(phone or monitor) can be seen from outside and remaining place of 
  glass can still act as mirror. so we will be basicaaly using this principle in our project. liek first of all we place a monitor behind the reflective mirror and then the
  first of all the it will normall act as mirror we can't see anything behind that, but if monitor is turned the place from where light source is coming from monitor like 
  date-time,etc can be seen from outside of the mirror.  
  
  Next thing i did is i searched the what are the material required to make this project. i made their list and how will they be used in project and made the rouch sketch .

After this i made the Bill of Materials and made the google sheet, which i uploaded in the repository.

After doing this i created the Gihub repository and arranged the files ,basically did this github repo work .

# Day 2
# What i did Today
so day was a quite important for this project. I read tons of articles on many websites , did watch tons of videos , and finally able to finalize how will i be 
able to work and complete this project.
1. setup the software and operating System.
 I was a bit worried about the software setup for the project but today's working on this got me the idea. We will be using MagicMirror framework which now i am finalizing as it has open source and has a wide community that will be helpful if any future error arises in the project.we can add further modules , there are many.
2. Hardware assembly 
 after finalizing how the software setup will be done Then i was figuring out how will i be able to make the wooden frame for the mirror where all parts will be assembled and setted up. so i will get the wooden ply which will not cause any harm to our equipments. how the mirror and monitor can be kept safe that was one concern , so will be providing some cution to protect it .

3. I was looking if all the parts required for the project is listed or not in the bill of materials.i had forgotten to include the memory card in the list i did that. then the final list was done.

After this i am applying for the grant. i want to work on this project as soon as possible as it is making me very excited.


# Next Steps after Grant
  so first of all i will try to buy the items listed items as soon as possible.
  once all the items are ordered i will wait for delivery of them . Till the items are being delivered i will try to make the wooden frame,ensuring to provide cushion to the monitor and glass do not get scratched or damaged. after the items are delivered , i will install the opearting system and then the magic mirror software setup.
