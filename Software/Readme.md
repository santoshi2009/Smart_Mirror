# Software Plan

# OS setup 
To setup windows first of all we will require a flash card to install the os in memory card.we will then we will insert the memory card and after downloading the raspberry pi imager software we will flash the Operating system in the memory card. Then after installing the Operating System in the memory card ,we wil insert in the raspberry pi , now our operating system installation is done.

# Software Setup
  we will use the MagicMirror framework as it is opensource and has a community that can help us if any software or hardware problem arises in future.we can also add 
  further apis modules like other voice modules as the they have wide community that have given many opensource apis that can also be implemented in the project. 
  fisrt we will be mainly focusing on making our project workable i.e a minmal viable product, not much bulky which brings error.
